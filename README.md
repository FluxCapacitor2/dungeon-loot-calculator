# Dungeon Loot Calculator

A website that gathers drop chances from the [Hypixel SkyBlock Wiki](https://wiki.hypixel.net/Main_Page) and uses them to calculate an expected value for each dungeon floor and loot chest.

This project has two subprojects:

- The **`extractor`** is a Node.js script that fetches SkyBlock Wiki pages, parses their HTML content, and converts the set of tabs and tables into a JSON file.
- The **`website`** is a Next.js site which uses the data file generated by the `extractor` and auction price data from [Tricked's `lowestbins`](https://github.com/Tricked-dev/lowestbins) to calculate expected value per run and whether it is worth the cost to reroll chests.
